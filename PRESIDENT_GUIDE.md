## 👥 Adding/Updating Officers {#adding-officers}

### Step 1: Prepare the Officer Photo

1. **Take or get a professional photo** of the officer

   - Square format works best (crop to 1:1 ratio)
   - Good lighting, plain background preferred
   - File size: Keep under 2MB

2. **Name the file properly**

   - Format: `firstname-lastname.jpg`
   - Example: `john-doe.jpg`
   - Use lowercase, hyphens between words
   - Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

3. **Upload the photo**
   - Navigate to: `/public/images/team/`
   - Drag and drop your photo into this folder

### Step 2: Add Officer Information

1. **Open the team file**

   - Go to: `/src/content/data/team.ts`

2. **Find the template** (it's at the bottom with comments)

   ```typescript
   // TEMPLATE - Copy this:
   // {
   //   id: "officer-XXX",
   //   name: "Full Name",
   //   position: "Position Title",
   //   ...
   // },
   ```

3. **Copy the template** and paste it INSIDE the `executiveBoard` array

4. **Fill in the information**

   ```typescript
   {
     id: "officer-004",              // Change number (must be unique)
     name: "Sarah Johnson",          // Officer's full name
     position: "Treasurer",          // Their position
     major: "Computer Science",      // Their major
     graduationYear: "2027",         // Graduation year
     bio: "Passionate about AI and machine learning...", // Short bio
     image: "/images/team/sarah-johnson.jpg",  // Path to their photo
     email: "sarah.johnson@txst.edu",  // Optional
     linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/sarahjohnson", // Optional
   },
   ```

5. **Important**: Make sure there's a comma after the closing `}`

6. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

### Example: Adding a New President

**Before:**

```typescript
export const executiveBoard: TeamMember[] = [
  {
    id: "officer-001",
    name: "John Doe",
    position: "President",
    ...
  },
  // More officers here
];
```

**After:**

```typescript
export const executiveBoard: TeamMember[] = [
  {
    id: "officer-001",
    name: "John Doe",
    position: "President",
    ...
  },
  {
    id: "officer-004",
    name: "Sarah Johnson",
    position: "Vice President",
    major: "Computer Engineering",
    graduationYear: "2027",
    bio: "Excited to help IEEE TXST grow this year!",
    image: "/images/team/sarah-johnson.jpg",

## 🔧 Common Issues & Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Issue: Photo Doesn't Show Up

**Solution:**

1. Check the file path is correct: `/images/team/firstname-lastname.jpg`
2. Make sure the file exists in `/public/images/team/`
3. Check file name matches exactly (case-sensitive!)
4. Try refreshing the page with Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)

### Issue: Website Shows an Error After Editing

**Solution:**

1. Check for missing commas between items
2. Make sure all quotes are closed: `"text"` not `"text`
3. Check brackets are balanced: every `{` has a matching `}`
4. If stuck, press Ctrl+Z (undo) until it works again

### Issue: Changes Don't Appear

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you saved the file (Ctrl+S)
2. Wait 5-10 seconds for the website to rebuild
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Image is Too Large/Slow to Load

**Solution:**

1. Compress the image using:
   - TinyPNG.com (easiest)
   - Squoosh.app (more options)
2. Aim for under 500KB for photos
3. Re-upload the compressed version
